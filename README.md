SimpleAccount
=============

Fairly simple page to create an account using AngularJs, Asp.net MVC frameworks


###Requirement:

Visual studio 2012 with .net 4.5, nuget


Woops, I dont have visual studio. All you need is Ruby. Install Ruby and bundler

'bundle install' to get the required gems (rake and albacore)

and do the following to build the solution

####Debug is default
rake build:build 

####To build with config
rake build:build['Release']
